# Web-based Voting Osis

This is a limited project, by Reinaldy Rafli ([@reinaldyrfl](http://instagram.com/reinaldyrfl)) and Joshua Nurdi ([@joshuanurdi](http://instagram.com/joshuanurdi)). The school commitee ask us to make this, so we made this.

### Version
0.2.0

### Tech

We use these:

* JQuery
* Bootstrap
* Font-awesome
* Normalize.css
* *what else I forgot...*

And of course this is open source, so it should be fine.

### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

This version uses HTML (with localStorage for saving the datas, not cookies nor session), JavaScript, some CSS. The future plan is we're gonna write it to [SmallBasic](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=small%20basic), that insert the values and some datas, then render it into HTML again. Yeah, still the same.

Email me right? reinaldyrfl[at]gmail[dot]com. Thanks!
